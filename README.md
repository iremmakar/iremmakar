### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


######  I'm Ä°rem Akar. I'm a computer engineer. I like improve myself in the software field. I think that working with a team rather than working individually improves the person more. Because different ideas means to new horizons. This speeds up the development and process. 

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Html, Css, Bootstrap, Javascript and React.
 - I know about Java, Spring Boot and SQL. And i wrote api and viewed these apis via swagger. I used jpa repository as ORM tool.
 - I know about C# and Entity Framework.
 - I want to be a full stack developer in the future.
